~~corssings~~

 and add code  with the specific language markings
 
```python
def convert_to_celsius(tempF)
   '''Precondition is that tempF will be the temperature in Fahrenheit
   This function takes the temperature in fahrenheit as a parameter and return the value in ceslsius
   >>> convert_to_celsius(75)
   23.8888888888'''
   return (tempF-32) * 5/9
   ```
