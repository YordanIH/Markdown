In the Markdown Article I learned how to make formated text.

## how to make  headings
### with varying their sizes
#### just like this
 you can cross text out
 
~~corssings~~

 
 You can format text by making it *italic* or **bold** and add code  with the specific language color markings.
 
```python
def convert_to_celsius(tempF)
   '''Precondition is that tempF will be the temperature in Fahrenheit
   This function takes the temperature in fahrenheit as a parameter and return the value in ceslsius
   >>> convert_to_celsius(75)
   23.8888888888'''
   return (tempF-32) * 5/9
   ```

# There is a way to create tables


|    | Column1 | Column2
--- | --- | ---
Row1 | info | info
Row2 | info | info

## You can create a list of tasks and mark what is complete and what not

### Task
  
- [x] Complete

- [ ] Not

### You can format bullet points

* List item 1 
* List item 2
  * List item 2.1
  * List item 2.2
* List item 3

### you can put inline code like this `def function(a: int)`

you can quote someone or mention them @YordanIH

Someone told me:

>Hey Yordan, how are you doing?
